#######
Summary
#######

The new appstore frontend project can be found at https://github.com/helxplatform/helx-ui.

Along with handling all of the user based appstore interactions post authentication
the frontend project builds and packages it's own artifacts which appstore consumes
via a docker multistage build.

This django app/view is responsible for authenticating the user and 
serving the frontend assets.

#############
Configuration
#############

Serving of the frontend has been setup to understand as little as possible about
[helx-ui](https://github.com/helxplatform/helx-ui) as long as the following
criteria is met a frontend will be rendered after auth.

* The frontend will provide `index.html` which will be placed in `frontend/templates`
during the appstore build.
* The frontend assets will be available at `./frontend/static/frontend` so that it is
collected by the `collectstatic` step and put into a `frontend` directory in
the static root.

.. note::
**The frontend should load assets from this path**.

###
Dev
###

For local development you can run `bin/appstore image frontend` which will
provide the frontend resources to your local development environment. Following
that with `bin/appstore start {brand}` will then run `collectstatic` and database
migrations finishing local appstore setup.

#####
Build
#####

For deployments the frontend artifacts are managed with a multistage build. In
`Dockerfile` we pull the frontend image and then copy the webpack artifacts to
`frontend/static` which will then be picked up with the `CMD` step at container
start.
